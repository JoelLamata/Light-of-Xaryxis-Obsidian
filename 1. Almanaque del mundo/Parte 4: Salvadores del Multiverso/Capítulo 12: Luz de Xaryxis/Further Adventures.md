This section provides a couple suggestions for how you can continue this campaign:

**Beyond the Eye of Doom.** Is the Eye of Doom in [[Sistema Wildspace: Doomspace|Doomspace]] a gateway to a new Wildspace system? One or more NPCs encourage the characters to mount an expedition to discover what lies on the other side of the vortex.

**Back to Bral.** If the characters return to the [[La Roca de Bral|Rock of Bral]], tales of their heroism travel quickly to the palace of Starhaven, where the characters are invited to meet Prince Andru. Perhaps the Bralian monarch has a quest for them!

_The_ _end ... ?_
