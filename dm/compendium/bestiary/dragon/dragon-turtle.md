## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The dragon turtle can breathe air and water.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon turtle makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. It can make one tail attack in place of its two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+13` (+13 to hit), reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 3d12 + 7|avg` (`3d12 + 7`) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+13` (+13 to hit), reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 2d8 + 7|avg` (`2d8 + 7`) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+13` (+13 to hit), reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 3d12 + 7|avg` (`3d12 + 7`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the dragon turtle and knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Steam Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon turtle exhales scalding steam in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 15d6|avg` (`15d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage.
