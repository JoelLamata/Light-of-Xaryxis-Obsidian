## Traits

***Advanced Telepathy.*** The flumph can perceive the content of any telepathic communication used within 60 feet of it, and it can't be surprised by creatures with any form of telepathy.

***Prone Deficiency.*** If the flumph is knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone), roll a die. On an odd result, the flumph lands upside-down and is [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated). At the end of each of its turns, the flumph can make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, righting itself and ending the [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition if it succeeds.

***Telepathic Shroud.*** The flumph is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as all divination spells.

## Actions

***Tendrils.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+4` (+4 to hit), reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `dice: 1d4 + 2|avg` (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage plus `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) acid damage. At the end of each of its turns, the target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) acid damage on a failure or ending the recurring acid damage on a success. A [lesser restoration](compendium/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell cast on the target also ends the recurring acid damage.

***Stench Spray (1/Day).*** Each creature in a 15-foot cone originating from the flumph must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be coated in a foul-smelling liquid. A coated creature exudes a horrible stench for `dice: 1d4|avg` (`1d4`) hours. The coated creature is [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) as long as the stench lasts, and other creatures are [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) while with in 5 feet of the coated creature. A creature can remove the stench on itself by using a short rest to bathe in water, alcohol, or vinegar.
