## Traits

***Distress Spores.*** When the myconid takes damage, all other myconids within 240 feet of it can sense its pain.

***Sun Sickness.*** While in sunlight, the myconid has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The myconid dies if it spends more than 1 hour in direct sunlight.

## Actions

***Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+2` (+2 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 2d4|avg` (`2d4`) bludgeoning damage plus `dice: 2d4|avg` (`2d4`) poison damage.

***Pacifying Spores (3/Day).*** The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#stunned) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Rapport Spores.*** A 20-foot radius of spores extends from the myconid. These spores can go around corners and affect only creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or higher that aren't undead, constructs, or elementals. Affected creatures can communicate telepathically with one another while they are within 30 feet of each other. The effect lasts for 1 hour.
