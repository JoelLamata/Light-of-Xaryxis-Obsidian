## Traits

***False Appearance.*** While the assassin vine remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal plant.

## Actions

***Constrict.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+6` (+6 to hit), reach 20 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target takes `dice: 2d6 + 4|avg` (`2d6 + 4`) bludgeoning damage, and it is [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and it takes `dice: 6d6|avg` (`6d6`) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The vine can constrict only one target at a time.

***Entangling Vines.*** The assassin vine can animate normal vines and roots on the ground in a 15-foot square within 30 feet of it. These plants turn the ground in that area into difficult terrain. A creature in that area when the effect begins must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by entangling vines and roots. A creature [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the plants can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength ([Athletics](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check, freeing itself on a successful check. The effect ends after 1 minute or when the assassin vine dies or uses Entangling Vines again.
