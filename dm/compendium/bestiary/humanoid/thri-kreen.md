## Traits

***Chameleon Carapace.*** The thri-kreen can change the color of its carapace to match the color and texture of its surroundings. As a result, it has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide.

***Standing Leap.*** The thri-kreen's long jump is up to 30 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The thri-kreen makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+3` (+3 to hit), reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `dice: 1d6 + 1|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) while [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way. The [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+3` (+3 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 2d4 + 1|avg` (`2d4 + 1`) slashing damage.
