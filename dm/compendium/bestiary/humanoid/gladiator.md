## Traits

***Brave.*** The gladiator has advantage on saving throws against being [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened).

***Brute.*** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the gladiator hits with it (included in the attack).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The gladiator makes three melee attacks or two ranged attacks.

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+7` (+7 to hit), reach 5 ft. and range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 2d6 + 4|avg` (`2d6 + 4`) piercing damage, or `dice: 2d8 + 4|avg` (`2d8 + 4`) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Shield Bash.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+7` (+7 to hit), reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `dice: 2d4 + 4|avg` (`2d4 + 4`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone).

## Reactions

***Parry.*** The gladiator adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the gladiator must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
