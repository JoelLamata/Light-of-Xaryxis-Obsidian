## Traits

***Martial Advantage.*** Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra `dice: 4d6|avg` (`4d6`) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet of an ally of the hobgoblin that isn't [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The hobgoblin makes three melee attacks. Alternatively, it can make two ranged attacks with its javelins.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+9` (+9 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 1d8 + 3|avg` (`1d8 + 3`) slashing damage, or `dice: 1d10 + 3|avg` (`1d10 + 3`) slashing damage if used with two hands.

***Shield Bash.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+9` (+9 to hit), reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `dice: 1d4 + 3|avg` (`1d4 + 3`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Javelin.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+9` (+9 to hit), reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 1d6 + 3|avg` (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage.

***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the hobgoblin can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a `dice: d4|avg` (`d4`) to its roll provided it can hear and understand the hobgoblin. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the hobgoblin is [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

## Reactions

***Parry.*** The hobgoblin adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the hobgoblin must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
