## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The kuo-toa can breathe air and water.

***Slippery.*** The kuo-toa has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the kuo-toa has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The kuo-toa makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its pincer staff.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+4` (+4 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 1d4 + 2|avg` (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Pincer Staff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+4` (+4 to hit), reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 1d6 + 2|avg` (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the kuo-toa can't use its pincer staff on another target.
