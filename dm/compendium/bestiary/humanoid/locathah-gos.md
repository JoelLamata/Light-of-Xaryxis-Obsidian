# Locathah
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 243*  

These resilient and proud fish-folk (found in Danger at Dunwater) have endured war, slavery, and mistreatment at the hands of other aquatic creatures. They dwell in submerged tribal communities along seacoasts, and hunt both above and below the water.

***Limited Amphibiousness.*** The locathah can breathe air and water, but it needs to be submerged at least once every 4 hours to avoid suffocating.

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+3` (+3 to hit), reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 1d6 + 1|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) piercing damage, or `dice: 1d8 + 1|avg` (`1d8 + 1`) piercing damage if used with two hands.
