## Traits

***Firearms Knowledge.*** Krux's mastery of its weapons enables it to ignore the loading property of any firearm.

***Steady as She Goes.*** On the deck of a ship, Krux has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made against effects that would knock it [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone) or shove it overboard.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Krux makes two Longsword or Musket attacks.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+6` (+6 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 1d8 + 4|avg` (`1d8 + 4`) slashing damage, or `dice: 1d10 + 4|avg` (`1d10 + 4`) slashing damage if used with two hands.

***Musket.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+4` (+4 to hit), range 40/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 1d12 + 2|avg` (`1d12 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Force Grenade.*** Krux throws a grenade up to 60 feet, and the grenade explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice: 5d6|avg` (`5d6`) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After Krux throws the grenade, roll a `dice: d6|avg` (`d6`); on a roll of 4 or lower, Krux has no more grenades to throw.
