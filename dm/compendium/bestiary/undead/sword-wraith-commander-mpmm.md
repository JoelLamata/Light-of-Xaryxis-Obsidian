# Sword Wraith Commander
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 239*  

Sword wraith commanders haunt battlefields, attacking anyone who questions their valor but looking kindly on those who sing their praises.

## Sword Wraiths

When glory-obsessed warriors die in battle without honor, they might haunt the site as sword wraiths.

## Traits

***Turning Defiance.*** The commander and any other sword wraiths within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn Undead.

***Unusual Nature.*** The commander doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The commander makes two Longsword or Longbow attacks.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+7` (+7 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 1d8 + 4|avg` (`1d8 + 4`) slashing damage, or `dice: 1d10 + 4|avg` (`1d10 + 4`) slashing damage if used with two hands.

***Longbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+5` (+5 to hit), range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 1d8 + 2|avg` (`1d8 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Call to Honor (1/Day).*** If the commander has taken damage during this combat, it gives itself advantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn, and `dice: 1d4 + 1|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) [sword wraith warriors](compendium/bestiary/undead/sword-wraith-warrior-mpmm.md) appear in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of it. The warriors last until they drop to 0 hit points, and they take their turns immediately after the commander's turn on the same initiative count.

## Bonus Actions

***Martial Fury.*** The commander makes one Longsword or Longbow attack, which deals an extra `dice: 2d8|avg` (`2d8`) necrotic damage on a hit, and attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.
