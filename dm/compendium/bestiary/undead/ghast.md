## Traits

***Stench.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the ghast must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the ghast's Stench for 24 hours.

***Turn Defiance.*** The ghast and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+3` (+3 to hit), reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `dice: 2d8 + 3|avg` (`2d8 + 3`) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+5` (+5 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 2d6 + 3|avg` (`2d6 + 3`) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
