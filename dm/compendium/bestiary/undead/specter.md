## Traits

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The specter can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes `dice: 1d10|avg` (`1d10`) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the specter has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions

***Life Drain.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* `dice: d20+4` (+4 to hit), reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `dice: 3d6|avg` (`3d6`) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
