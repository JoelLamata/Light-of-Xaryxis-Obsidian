# Thri-kreen Mystic
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 61*  

Thri-kreen mystics use psionics to navigate difficult terrain in Wildspace, turn invisible, and drain life from their prey. They often serve as spelljammers aboard thri-kreen ships.

**At will**: levitate (self only), mage hand (the hand is invisible)

**1/day each**: freedom of movement (self only), invisibility (self only)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The thri-kreen makes two Gythka attacks or four Psychic Bolt attacks.

***Gythka.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`2d8 + 1`) slashing damage.

***Psychic Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) psychic damage.

***Drain Vitality (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The thri-kreen targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 32 (`5d12`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The thri-kreen regains hit points equal to the damage dealt.

## Bonus Actions
