# Ssurran Defiler
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 58, Light of Xaryxis*  

Ssurran defilers can lay waste to the plant life around them and draw vital energy at the same time from other creatures that are caught in the area.

## Traits

***Hold Breath.*** The ssurran can hold its breath for 15 minutes.

***Intellect Fortress.*** The ssurran's AC includes its Intelligence modifier.

***Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The ssurran casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability:

**At will**: [mage hand](compendium/spells/mage-hand.md) (the hand is invisible)

**1/day**: [invisibility](compendium/spells/invisibility.md) (self only)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The ssurran makes two Claw attacks and uses Defile (if available).

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+3` (+3 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 1d6 + 1|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) slashing damage plus `dice: 1d8|avg` (`1d8`) necrotic damage.

***Defile (Recharge 6).*** Ordinary vegetation within 10 feet of the ssurran withers and dies. In addition, each creature within 10 feet of the ssurran must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 4d10|avg` (`4d10`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The ssurran regains `dice: 1d10|avg` (`1d10`) hit points for each creature that fails the saving throw.
