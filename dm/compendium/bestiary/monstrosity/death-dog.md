## Traits

***Two-Headed.*** The dog has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks and on saving throws against being [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#blinded), [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#deafened), [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened), [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#stunned), or knocked [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#unconscious).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dog makes two bite attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+4` (+4 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 1d6 + 2|avg` (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw against disease or become [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the creature must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by `dice: 1d10|avg` (`1d10`) on a failure. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
