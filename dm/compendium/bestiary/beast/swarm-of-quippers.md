## Traits

***Blood Frenzy.*** The swarm has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hit points.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny quipper. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

***Water Breathing.*** The swarm can breathe only underwater.

## Actions

***Bites.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+5` (+5 to hit), reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. *Hit:* `dice: 4d6|avg` (`4d6`) piercing damage, or `dice: 2d6|avg` (`2d6`) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
