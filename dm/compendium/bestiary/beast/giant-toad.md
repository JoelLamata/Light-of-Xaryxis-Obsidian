## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The toad can breathe air and water.

***Standing Leap.*** The toad's long jump is up to 20 feet and its high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+4` (+4 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 1d10 + 2|avg` (`1d10 + 2`) piercing damage plus `dice: 1d10|avg` (`1d10`) poison damage, and the target is [grappled](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and the toad can't bite another target.

***Swallow.*** The toad makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the toad, and it takes `dice: 3d6|avg` (`3d6`) acid damage at the start of each of the toad's turns. The toad can have only one target swallowed at a time.

If the toad dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone).
