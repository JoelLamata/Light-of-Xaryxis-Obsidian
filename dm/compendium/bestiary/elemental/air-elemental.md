## Traits

***Air Form.*** The elemental can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The elemental makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice: d20+8` (+8 to hit), reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice: 2d8 + 5|avg` (`2d8 + 5`) bludgeoning damage.

***Whirlwind (Recharge 4-6).*** Each creature in the elemental's space must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes `dice: 3d8 + 2|avg` (`3d8 + 2`) bludgeoning damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the elemental in a random direction and knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone). If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes `dice: 1d6|avg` (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone).

If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't flung away or knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone).
