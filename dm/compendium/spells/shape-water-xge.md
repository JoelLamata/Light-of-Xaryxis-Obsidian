# Shape Water
*cantrip, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous,  up to 1 hour

You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

- You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn't have enough force to cause damage.  
- You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.  
- You change the water's color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.  
- You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.  

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
