# Mordenkainen's Sword
*7th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.

When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes `dice: 3d10|avg` (`3d10`) force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.

**Classes**: [Bard](compendium/classes/bard.md), [Cleric (Arcana Domain)](compendium/classes/cleric-arcana-domain-scag.md), [Wizard](compendium/classes/wizard.md)
