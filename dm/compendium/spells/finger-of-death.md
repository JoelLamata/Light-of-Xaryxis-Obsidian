# Finger of Death
*7th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes `dice: 7d8 + 30|avg` (`7d8 + 30`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a [zombie](compendium/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.

**Classes**: [Cleric (Arcana Domain)](compendium/classes/cleric-arcana-domain-scag.md), [Sorcerer](compendium/classes/sorcerer.md), [Warlock](compendium/classes/warlock.md), [Wizard](compendium/classes/wizard.md)
