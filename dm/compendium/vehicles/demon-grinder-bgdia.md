## Traits

**Crushing Wheels** The Demon Grinder can move through the space of any Large or smaller creature. When it does, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice: 4d10|avg` (`4d10`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone). If the creature was already [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone), it takes an extra `dice: 4d10|avg` (`4d10`) bludgeoning damage. This trait can't be used against a particular creature more than once each turn.

**Magic Weapons** The Demon Grinder's weapon attacks are magical.

**Prone Deficiency** If the Demon Grinder rolls over and falls [prone](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#prone), it can't right itself and is [incapacitated](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) until flipped upright.

## Action Stations
