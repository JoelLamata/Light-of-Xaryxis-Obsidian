Matalotok, the Frost Father, is an ancient hammer fashioned by Thrym, the god of frost giants. The favored weapon of the demon lord [Kostchtchie](compendium/bestiary/npc/kostchtchie-bgdia.md), Matalotok is frigid to the touch and wreathed in mist.

You are immune to cold damage while holding Matalotok. Whenever it deals damage to a creature, the hammer radiates a burst of intense cold in a 30-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area takes `dice: 3d6|avg` (`3d6`) cold damage.
